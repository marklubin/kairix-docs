# Kairix Documentation Repository

This directory contains project documentation for the Kairix Hierarchical Memory System.

## Contents

- `hierarchical-memory-system-project-plan.md` - Comprehensive project plan with phased execution approach, milestones, and GitHub workflow

## Project Overview

The Hierarchical Memory System (HMS) is a tiered memory architecture for LLMs that enables intelligent context retention, concept compaction, and eventual LoRA generation from important memories.

## Getting Started

To begin working with this documentation:

1. Review the project plan to understand the overall architecture and development approach
2. Examine the phased milestones to see the implementation roadmap
3. Reference the individual feature requests for detailed task breakdowns

## Development Tracks

The project is organized into four parallel development tracks:

1. **Foundation Tier** - Event-sourced storage system
2. **Memory Hierarchy** - Tiered memory with concept compaction
3. **Integration Layer** - LLM system interfaces
4. **LoRA Pipeline** - Knowledge crystallization capabilities
